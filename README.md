# MNIST Neural Network - Pre-trained Model Deployment

An interactive web application showcasing a pre-trained feedforward neural network for MNIST handwritten digit classification. This deployment-optimized version uses a locally trained model with static training visualizations for efficient cloud hosting.

## ðŸš€ **Live Demo Deployment (Railway)**

This app is perfectly optimized for Railway deployment with the following features:
- âœ… **Pre-trained Model**: No training required - uses a high-performance pre-trained model (98.16% test accuracy)
- âœ… **Static Assets**: Training plots and model info generated locally for fast loading
- âœ… **Memory Efficient**: Minimal resource usage with pre-saved test data
- âœ… **Instant Testing**: Immediate predictions on handwritten digits
- âœ… **Educational Ready**: Perfect for demonstrating neural network capabilities

### **Quick Railway Deployment:**

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Railway deployment with pre-trained model"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Railway**:
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign up with your GitHub account
   - Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select this repository
   - Railway will automatically detect the Python app and deploy!

3. **Automatic Setup**:
   - Railway reads `Procfile` and `requirements.txt`
   - Loads pre-trained model (`static/mnist_model.h5`)
   - Serves static training plots and assets
   - Assigns a public URL (e.g., `https://mnist-classifier-production.up.railway.app`)

4. **Share with Students**:
   - Copy the Railway URL and share with your class
   - Students can immediately test the neural network on handwritten digits
   - Perfect for demonstrating machine learning concepts!
