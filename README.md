# MNIST Neural Network Trainer

An interactive web application for training feedforward neural networks on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. Students can start training with a button click and watch real-time plots of loss and accuracy during training.

## ðŸš€ **Live Demo Deployment (Railway)**

This app is optimized for Railway deployment with the following features:
- âœ… **Smart port handling**: Uses Railway's assigned PORT environment variable
- âœ… **Resource optimized**: Limited to 15 epochs for efficient cloud usage
- âœ… **Fast startup**: ~10-15 seconds for MNIST dataset loading
- âœ… **Educational ready**: Perfect for classroom use

### **Quick Railway Deployment:**

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Railway deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Railway**:
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign up with your GitHub account
   - Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select this repository
   - Railway will automatically detect the Python app and deploy!

3. **Automatic Setup**:
   - Railway reads `Procfile` and `requirements.txt`
   - Installs all dependencies automatically
   - Assigns a public URL (e.g., `https://mnist-trainer-production.up.railway.app`)

4. **Share with Students**:
   - Copy the Railway URL and share with your class
   - Students can access immediately - no setup required!

## Features

- **Interactive Training**: Start neural network training with a simple button click
- **Real-time Visualization**: 
  - Training and validation loss plots updated in real-time
  - Training and validation accuracy plots updated in real-time
  - Progress tracking with epoch counters
- **Model Testing**: After training, test individual images and see predictions
- **Educational Interface**: 
  - Model architecture display
  - Dataset information (51K train, 9K validation, 10K test samples)
  - Training parameter controls (epochs: 1-15, batch size: 16-512)
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with real-time charts using Chart.js

## Neural Network Architecture

The application uses a feedforward neural network with:
- Input layer: 784 neurons (28x28 flattened MNIST images)
- Hidden layer 1: 128 neurons with ReLU activation + Dropout (0.2)
- Hidden layer 2: 64 neurons with ReLU activation + Dropout (0.2)
- Output layer: 10 neurons with softmax activation (digit classes 0-9)
- **Total Parameters**: 109,386

## Local Development

1. **Install Dependencies**:
