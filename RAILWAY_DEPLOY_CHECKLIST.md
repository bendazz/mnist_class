## Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Railway deployment - pre-trained MNIST classifier"
git push origin main

# 2. Deploy to Railway
# - Go to railway.app
# - Create new project
# - Deploy from GitHub repo
# - Wait for build completion

# 3. Test deployment
# - Open Railway URL
# - Verify model info loads
# - Test random image prediction
# - Check training plots display
```

## Expected Performance

- **Startup Time**: 15-30 seconds (TensorFlow initialization)
- **Memory Usage**: ~200MB (optimized)
- **Test Accuracy**: 98.16%
- **Available Test Images**: 2,000
- **Response Time**: <1 second for predictions

## Success Indicators

âœ… **Build Success**: All dependencies install without errors
âœ… **Model Loading**: "Pre-trained model loaded successfully!" in logs
âœ… **Test Data Loading**: "Test data loaded successfully! 2000 test images available." in logs
âœ… **Server Start**: "Server ready for predictions!" in logs
âœ… **Health Check**: `/api` endpoint returns status
âœ… **Frontend**: Interface loads with model info displayed
âœ… **Predictions**: Random test images work correctly
âœ… **Static Assets**: Training plot image displays
